- **`useRouter` Hook**: This hook from `next/navigation` is used to programmatically navigate users to different pages within the Next.js application.

### How They Work Together

1. **Session and Router Initialization**: The component initializes session data (`data`) and status (`status`) using the `useSession` hook. It also initializes the router using `useRouter`.

2. **Effect for Redirection**: Inside a `useEffect` hook, the component checks the session status:
   - If the status is "loading", it does nothing further to avoid premature redirection.
   - If session data (`data`) is present, it indicates that the user is authenticated. The component then redirects the user to a dashboard sub-page based on their role (`data.user.role`). If no role is specified, it defaults to "user".
   - If there is no session data, indicating the user is not authenticated, it redirects the user to the "/login" page.

3. **Conditional Rendering**: While the session status is loading, it renders a "Loading..." message. Once it finishes checking the session, if the user is about to be redirected, it briefly shows a "redirecting..." message.

This setup ensures that users are appropriately routed based on their authentication status and role, enhancing both security and user experience within the application.

=== Feature Summary for full-stack-nextjs/app/dashboard/page.tsx ===
The provided TypeScript/TSX file is part of a Next.js project and implements an authentication-based redirection feature within the dashboard of the application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionality, important components, and how they work together:

### Main Functionality
The primary functionality of this file is to handle user session checking and redirect users based on their authentication status and role. It ensures that users are either directed to their respective dashboard pages based on their roles or redirected to the login page if they are not authenticated.

### Important Components and Functions
1. **useSession**: This hook, provided by `next-auth/react`, is used to access the session data and status. It helps determine if a user is logged in and retrieves user-related information such as their role.

2. **useRouter**: This hook, from `next/navigation`, is used for programmatic navigation. It allows the component to redirect users to different pages based on the authentication and role data obtained from the `useSession` hook.

3. **useEffect**: A React hook that performs side effects in functional components. In this case, it is used to check the session status and perform the redirection logic whenever session data changes or the component mounts.

### How They Work Together
- **Session Handling**: When the component is rendered, `useSession` checks the session status. The component initially shows a loading message until the session status is determined.

- **Redirection Logic**:
  - If the session status is "loading", the component does nothing until the authentication status is resolved.
  - Once the session status is resolved, the effect checks if session data is available:
    - If authenticated (`data` is present), the router navigates the user to their role-specific dashboard (e.g., `/dashboard/admin` if the role is "admin").
    - If not authenticated (`data` is null or undefined), the router redirects the user to the `/login` page.

- **User Feedback**: While the session status is loading, a loading message is displayed. After the status is resolved, a "redirecting..." message is shown until navigation is complete.

This setup ensures secure access to dashboard pages by redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page while authenticated users are directed to the appropriate dashboard based on their role.
